*Halloween Night Sky over the French Countryside*

While Halloween never attained the same level of popularity in France as
Christmas, I've always had a fondness for the former over the latter. In the
past, we would decorate our countryside home with glowing, carved pumpkins,
creating a truly unique nighttime landscape.

Although my childhood and the house I grew up in are now distant memories, the
emotions and the ambiance of Halloween continue to resonate in me as the 
holiday comes every year.

## A spooky project

Recently, I had some interest learning Bevy, a trendy game engine written in 
Rust. Although it is usable not only for games, its ECS (Entities-Components-Systems) 
makes it really easy to get started with 2D and 3D real-time projects.

With Halloween and Bevy in my mind, I wanted to create a small animation project
related to that even in a week or so. My initial plan was to draw small ghosts
on the screen and make them move around over time. 

For a reason I don't understand, every time there is something to draw on screen,
I have the unreasonable tendency to assemble primitives shapes together.

However I realized soon enough that Bevy is quite limited in terms of shapes (unless you use the
lion plugin). I did not want to spend to much time trying to organize hierarchically shapes between themselves
for an ungly and unsatisfying ghost.

So I went with a sprite approach, simply displaying a PNG image in the window.
At that moment , 

searching for Bevy examples, I came across one showing how to scale objects
over time. The idea come from that point.

## Realization
The end result:

## What I learned

- ECS concept
- Bevy
- minimp3 and the mp3 format

## What I struggled with

The following points are to be taken with a grain of salt as I am not a Bevy nor
a WASM expert. There are probably easy ways to come around these issues, but due
to time constraints I did not want to bother too much.

- Building the project in WASM and making it running the webpage was part of
my initial goal, but I could not compile to that target with minimp3.
- Creating dynamic resources in Bevy with a CLI
- Drawing and organizing 2D shapes
