Welcome to the first *official* devlog post! You can still 
[read the previous devlog entry](https://boreec.github.io/posts/devlog-0000/) to
understand the project and the idea behind. In this entry, I'll mainly share
some map improvements I've been working on.

## Bug Fixing: Player spawning on a non-walkable tile

Originally, the player had a hardcoded spawn point at (0,0) regardless of the
tile. But, since the stones are randomly generated on the map, it can lead to
situations where the player spawns on a non-walkable tile.

```rust
fn spawn_player(mut commands: Commands, tileset: Res<TilesetMain>) {
    let map_position = MapPosition::new(0, 0); // hardcoded spawn :(
    let (sprite_x, sprite_y) = calculate_sprite_position(&map_position);
    commands.spawn(PlayerBundle {
        player: Player,
        position: map_position,
        sprite: SpriteSheetBundle {
            texture_atlas: tileset.0.clone(),
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(sprite_x, sprite_y, Z_INDEX_ACTOR),
            sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(SPRITE_IDX_PLAYER),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    });
}
```

*bug: Player spawning on a stone*

---

**Solution**: To fix this, the player's spawning position needs to be given by
the `Map`. It implies a the map being created before the player. To make sure
things are done in this order, I decided to split the previous
`GameState::Initializing` state in two:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, States)]
pub enum GameState {
    #[default]
    Uninitialized,
    InitializingMap,
    InitializingPlayer,
    PlayerTurn,
    EnemyTurn,
}
```

```rust
    .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::InitializingMap), initialize_map)
    .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::InitializingPlayer), initialize_player)
```

When initializing the player, its spawn position is given by a method
implemented via the `Map` (now taken as a parameter):

```rust
pub fn generate_random_spawning_position(&self) -> MapPosition {
    let spawnable_positions: Vec<_> = self
        .tiles
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .filter(|(_, tile)| tile.is_walkable())
        .map(|(index, _)| index)
        .collect();

    if spawnable_positions.is_empty() {
        panic!("There are no spawnable positions");
    }

    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let index = *spawnable_positions.choose(&mut rng).unwrap();

    MapPosition::new(index % self.width, index / self.height)
}
```

```rust
fn initialize_player(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut game_next_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
    query_map: Query<&Map>,
    tileset: Res<TilesetMain>,
) {
    let map = query_map.single();
    let map_position = map.generate_random_spawning_position();
    let (sprite_x, sprite_y) = calculate_sprite_position(&map_position);
    commands.spawn(PlayerBundle {
        player: Player,
        position: map_position,
        sprite: SpriteSheetBundle {
            texture_atlas: tileset.0.clone(),
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(sprite_x, sprite_y, Z_INDEX_ACTOR),
            sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(SPRITE_IDX_PLAYER),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    });
    game_next_state.set(GameState::PlayerTurn);
}
```

## Bug Fixing: Pixel artifacts between tiles

There's an issue I had and that have been bothering me recently. It's related
to the way tiles are displayed on screen. If you pay close attention to the
following image, you'll notice vertical pixel artifacts between the tiles.

*Pixel artifacts between the tiles*

**Solution**: It seems to be [a known issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3593) related to Bevy's [MSAA](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/enum.Msaa.html).
After turning it off with `insert_resource(Msaa::Off)`, the pixel artifacts were gone. &#128513;

## Mechanics/System: Creating the map procedurally

With these issues fixed, I could focus on something more interesting: generating
the map procedurally. Naively, one could think that putting rocks randomly on
the map is enough, but in order to provide a better playability, we need to take
into account a couple of criteria:

1. **Harmony**: Using a total random placement feels heavily artificial. It's
   more enjoyable to walk in a terrain that looks somewhat natural or following
   a certain pattern.
2. **Walkable path**: In its simplest form, the path from the beginning to the
   end of a level must be walkable. It means that a player should never spawn
   trapped between rocks.

I haven't decided yet what type of goal I want to put in the level, so I decided
to focus on the first criteria for the moment. To generate the map procedurally,
I decided to explore using **Cellular Automaton** and **Perlin Noise**.

### With Cellular Automaton

I never considered that [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
could bring such flair to 2D map generation. It hit me when I stumbled upon 
these blog posts:

1. [Procedural Generation with Cellular Automata](https://bronsonzgeb.com/index.php/2022/01/30/procedural-generation-with-cellular-automata/), by Bronson Zgeb
2. [Procedural Level Generation in Games using a Cellular Automaton](https://www.kodeco.com/2425-procedural-level-generation-in-games-using-a-cellular-automaton-part-1?page=1), by Kim Pedersen


Exciting stuff, especially for someone like me who's dabbled in cellular
automata before, with several implementations of [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) 
and even my take on [Brian's Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain)
using Vulkan and Rust last year ([see it here](https://github.com/boreec/Brian-s-Brain)).

For generating level procedurally, I went with the same rules as Game of Life. 
here's the process I took for creating my cellular automaton:

1. Define a struct representing a cellular automaton and an enum representing
   the cellular states:
    ```rust
    #[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
    pub enum CellularState {
        Alive,
        Dead,
    }

    pub struct CellularAutomaton {
        pub width: usize,
        pub height: usize,
        pub cells: Vec<CellularState>,
    } 
    ```
2. Initialize the cellular automaton with random alive cells:
    ```rust
    impl CellularAutomaton {
    pub fn new(width: usize, height: usize, alive_probability: f64) -> Self {
        let cells = (0..width * height)
            .map(|_| {
                if rand::thread_rng().gen_bool(alive_probability) {
                    CellularState::Alive
                } else {
                    CellularState::Dead
                }
            })
            .collect();

        Self {
            width,
            height,
            cells,
        }
    }
    ```

3. The most important operation for making the cellular automaton evolves to
   the next generation is to apply rules to the cells. In Conway's Game of Life,
   a cell's state is determined based on its Von Neumann neighbors:
    ```rust
    /// Returns the flat indices of all Von Neumann neighbors for a given cell in a
    /// cellular automaton, considering borders and corners.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// `automaton`: A reference to a `CellularAutomaton` structure.
    /// `i`: The flat index of the target cell in the cells vector.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A vector containing flat indexes representing the target cell neighbors.
    pub fn enumerate_neighbors(
        automaton: &CellularAutomaton,
        i: usize,
    ) -> Vec<usize> {
        let mut neighbors = Vec::new();
        let x = i % automaton.width;
        let y = i / automaton.width;
        // left neighbor
        if x > 0 {
            neighbors.push(i - 1);
        }
        // right neighbor
        if x < automaton.width - 1 {
            neighbors.push(i + 1);
        }
        // top neighbor
        if y > 0 {
            neighbors.push((y - 1) * automaton.width + x);
        }
        // bottom neighbor
        if y < automaton.height - 1 {
            neighbors.push((y + 1) * automaton.width + x);
        }
        // top right neighbor
        if x < automaton.width - 1 && y > 0 {
            neighbors.push((y - 1) * automaton.width + x + 1);
        }
        // top left neighbor
        if x > 0 && y > 0 {
            neighbors.push((y - 1) * automaton.width + x - 1);
        }
        // bottom right neighbor
        if x < automaton.width - 1 && y < automaton.height - 1 {
            neighbors.push((y + 1) * automaton.width + x + 1);
        }
        // bottom left neighbor
        if x > 0 && y < automaton.height - 1 {
            neighbors.push((y + 1) * automaton.width + x - 1);
        }

        neighbors
    }
    ```

4. Finally, implement a transition function to create the next cellular
   automaton generation based on rules:
    ```rust
    impl CellularAutomaton{
            /// Advances the cellular automaton to the next generation based on
        /// predefined transition rules.
        ///
        /// This function applies rules to each cell, determining its state in the
        /// next generation based on the count of alive neighbors. The transition
        /// follows standard rules for Conway's Game of Life.
        ///
        /// # Remarks
        ///
        /// - Living cells with fewer than 2 or more than 3 alive neighbors die.
        /// - Dead cells with exactly 3 alive neighbors become alive.
        /// - Cells with 2 or 3 alive neighbors remain in their current state.
        pub fn transition(&mut self) {
            let mut next_generation = self.cells.clone();
            for (i, c) in self.cells.iter().enumerate() {
                let alive_neighbors =
                    count_neighbors_in_state(self, i, CellularState::Alive);

                next_generation[i] = match c {
                    CellularState::Alive => {
                        if alive_neighbors < 2 || alive_neighbors > 3 {
                            CellularState::Dead
                        } else {
                            CellularState::Alive
                        }
                    }
                    CellularState::Dead => {
                        if alive_neighbors == 3 {
                            CellularState::Alive
                        } else {
                            CellularState::Dead
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            self.cells = next_generation;
        }
    }
    ```

Now to convert the `CellularAutomaton` into an usable `Map`, I simply
implemented the `from` trait (see [related commit](https://github.com/boreec/roguelike/tree/3136b5be24f507a5962e39719a67ee16e2681bef)):

```rust
impl From<CellularAutomaton> for Map {
    fn from(ca: CellularAutomaton) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: ca.width,
            height: ca.height,
            tiles: ca
                .cells
                .iter()
                .map(|cellular_state| match cellular_state {
                    CellularState::Alive => TileType::GrassWithStone,
                    CellularState::Dead => TileType::Grass,
                })
                .collect(),
        }
    }
}
```

*Map created with a Conway's Game of Life automaton initially set to 50% alive cells and after 50 steps*

For those familiar with this automaton, the end result speaks for itself. But
satisfaction wasn't enough; I decided to add a smoothing touch. After the
automaton runs, I smooth the result by setting dead cells as alive if they have
more than 3 alive neighbors. This process repeats until no further changes 
occur.

```rust
impl CellularAutomaton{
    /// Applies a smoothing operation to the cellular automaton, updating cell
    // states based on neighboring conditions.
    ///
    /// It iteratively processes the current generation of cells, updating each
    /// cell's state based on the count of alive neighbors. The process
    /// continues until no further changes occur.
    pub fn smooth(&mut self) {
        let mut current_generation = self.cells.clone();
        let mut has_changed = true;

        while has_changed {
            has_changed = false;
            let mut next_generation = current_generation.clone();

            for (i, c) in current_generation.iter().enumerate() {
                let alive_neighbors =
                    count_neighbors_in_state(self, i, CellularState::Alive);

                if c == &CellularState::Dead && alive_neighbors > 3 {
                    next_generation[i] = CellularState::Alive;
                    has_changed = true;
                }
            }
            current_generation = next_generation.clone();
        }
        self.cells = current_generation;
    }
}
```

*Smoothing the end result*

The result is captivating. While I'm not sure if I'll use it, I'll keep this 
cellular automaton implementation in my toolkit as I explore other ideas. Next
up, let's compare this terrain generation with the power of Perlin Noise.
