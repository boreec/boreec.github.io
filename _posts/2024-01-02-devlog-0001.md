Welcome to the first *official* devlog post! You can still 
[read the previous devlog entry](https://boreec.github.io/posts/devlog-0000/) to
understand the project and the idea behind. In this entry, I'll mainly share
some map improvements I've been working on.

## Bug Fixing: Player spawning on a non-walkable tile

Initially, the player was hardcoded to spawn at (0,0) regardless of the tile.
But, since the stones are randomly generated on the map, it can lead to
situations where the player spawns on a non-walkable tile.

```rust
fn spawn_player(mut commands: Commands, tileset: Res<TilesetMain>) {
    let map_position = MapPosition::new(0, 0); // hardcoded spawn :(
    let (sprite_x, sprite_y) = calculate_sprite_position(&map_position);
    commands.spawn(PlayerBundle {
        player: Player,
        position: map_position,
        sprite: SpriteSheetBundle {
            texture_atlas: tileset.0.clone(),
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(sprite_x, sprite_y, Z_INDEX_ACTOR),
            sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(SPRITE_IDX_PLAYER),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    });
}
```

*bug: Player spawning on a stone*

--- 

**Solution**: To fix this, the player's spawning position needs to be given by
the `Map`. It implies a the map being created before the player. To make sure
things are done in this order, I decided I split the previous
`GameState::Initializing` state in two:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, States)]
pub enum GameState {
    #[default]
    Uninitialized,
    InitializingMap,
    InitializingPlayer,
    PlayerTurn,
    EnemyTurn,
}
```

```rust
    .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::InitializingMap), initialize_map)
    .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::InitializingPlayer), initialize_player)
```

When initializing the player, its spawn position is given by a method
implemented via the `Map` (now taken as a parameter):

```rust
pub fn generate_random_spawning_position(&self) -> MapPosition {
    let spawnable_positions: Vec<_> = self
        .tiles
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .filter(|(_, tile)| tile.is_walkable())
        .map(|(index, _)| index)
        .collect();

    if spawnable_positions.is_empty() {
        panic!("There are no spawnable positions");
    }

    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let index = *spawnable_positions.choose(&mut rng).unwrap();

    MapPosition::new(index % self.width, index / self.height)
}
```

```rust
fn initialize_player(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut game_next_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
    query_map: Query<&Map>,
    tileset: Res<TilesetMain>,
) {
    let map = query_map.single();
    let map_position = map.generate_random_spawning_position();
    let (sprite_x, sprite_y) = calculate_sprite_position(&map_position);
    commands.spawn(PlayerBundle {
        player: Player,
        position: map_position,
        sprite: SpriteSheetBundle {
            texture_atlas: tileset.0.clone(),
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(sprite_x, sprite_y, Z_INDEX_ACTOR),
            sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(SPRITE_IDX_PLAYER),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    });
    game_next_state.set(GameState::PlayerTurn);
}
```

## Closing Thoughts

As always, if you have any suggestions/remarks regarding the devlog content, the
code or anything else, please reach out! Don't hesitate to drop a &#11088; on the [project's page](https://github.com/roguelike). This has the effect
of immediately stopping me to procrastinate.
