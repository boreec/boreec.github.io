## Bug fixing: Player spawning on a stone

One issue with the current spawning system is that the player is always spawned
at (0,0). Since the stones are randomly generated on the map, it can lead to
situation where the player spawns on a rock.

```rust
fn spawn_player(mut commands: Commands, tileset: Res<TilesetMain>) {
    let map_position = MapPosition::new(0, 0);
    let (sprite_x, sprite_y) = calculate_sprite_position(&map_position);
    commands.spawn(PlayerBundle {
        player: Player,
        position: map_position,
        sprite: SpriteSheetBundle {
            texture_atlas: tileset.0.clone(),
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(sprite_x, sprite_y, Z_INDEX_ACTOR),
            sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(SPRITE_IDX_PLAYER),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    });
}
```

*bug: Player spawning on a stone*

**Solution**: The player needs to be created after the map is created and its
spawning position has to be provided by the map.

I splitted the previous `GameState::Initializing` in two states for creating
the map and the player:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, States)]
pub enum GameState {
    #[default]
    Uninitialized,
    InitializingMap,
    InitializingPlayer,
    PlayerTurn,
    EnemyTurn,
}
```
