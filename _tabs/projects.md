# Cellular Automata

## Brian's Brain

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian's_Brain):
> Brian's Brain is a cellular automaton devised by Brian Silverman, which is 
very similar to his Seeds rule. 

<p align="justify">
I originally made the project because I was interested in learning Vulkan while
improving my skills in Rust. The hardest part was to set up the graphics
pipeline and decomposing the shapes in vertices that can be processed by the
GPU.</p>

- **Tech Stack:** Rust, Vulkan
- **Source Code:** [GitHub](https://gitlab.com/boreec/brian-s-brain), [GitLab](https://github.com/boreec/Brian-s-Brain)
- **Demo:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0fTs15-Qg0)
