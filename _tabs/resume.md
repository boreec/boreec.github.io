## In a few words

<p align="justify">I am <strong>Cyprien Borée</strong>, a software engineer in
his twenties  from France. Since 2022, I have been living in Japan, Aichi 
prefecture with my wife and son. </p>


<p align="justify">My interest for computer science covers a wide range of 
areas, from the tangible, like low-level languages, data structures and 
algorithms, to the more abstract, including complexity theory, multi-objective
optimization, multi-agent systems, bioinformatics, cryptography, game 
engineering and many others.</p>

<p align=justify>Besides that, I enjoy watching movies, playing board games
such as chess or shogi and expanding my knowledge in surprising directions.
