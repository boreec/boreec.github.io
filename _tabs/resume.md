## In a few words

<p align="justify">I am <strong>Cyprien Borée</strong>, a software engineer in
his twenties  from France. Since 2022, I have been living in Japan, Aichi 
prefecture with my wife and son. </p>


<p align="justify">My interest for computer science covers a wide range of 
areas, from the tangible, like low-level languages, data structures and 
algorithms, to the more abstract, including complexity theory, multi-objective
optimization, multi-agent systems, bioinformatics, cryptography, game 
engineering and many others.</p>

<p align=justify>Besides that, I enjoy watching movies, playing board games
such as chess or shogi and expanding my knowledge in surprising directions.

  april 2023 → now: <b>Backend developer</b><br/>
  <i><a href="https://www.tensorenergy.jp/">Tensor Energy, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan (remote)</a></i><br/> 
  <p align="justify">I work on the infrastructure/back-end part of Tensor
  Energy cloud platform. My job consists of deploying and maintaining services
  in our distributed monolith architecture. I have been especially working on
  transactional and informational email service, energy forecast visualization
  and accuracy service, internal infrastructure monitoring service, and the
  main data lake. Besides that, I also contributed to unified tooling and 
  coding standards across repositories.<br/>
  <b>Tech Stack:</b> AWS, CDK, Figma, Github Actions, Github Registry, Go, 
  Grafana, GraphQL, Linear, Python, Sendgrid, SSH, Timestream, Typescript
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  march 2021 → july 2021 (5 months): <b>C++ developer intern</b><br/>
  <i><a href="https://orkad.univ-lille.fr/">CRIStAL laboratories, ORKAD team</a>, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France</i><br/>
  <p align="justify">I worked on multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs).
  My goal was to define criteria of diversity for the solutions of these
  problems and to benchmark the difference they bring compared to the 
  literature. My approach was based on memoization to compute efficiently the
  contribution of a solution to the whole diversity of the solutions.<br/>
  <b>Tech Stack:</b> C++17, Make
  </p>
  </li>

  october 2020 → february 2021 (5 months): <b>C++ developer intern</b><br/>
  <i><a href="https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/SMAC/">CRIStAL laboratories, SMAC team</a>, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France</i><br/>
  <p align="justify">I worked on simulating spread of viruses on a multi-agent
  system built on a random social network (Barabasi-Albert). The goal was to
  modelize the spread of Covid in France and build predictions.<br/>
  <b>Tech Stack:</b> C++11, Make
  </p>
  </li>

  june 2019 → september 2020 (1 year, 4 months): <b>Python developer</b><br/>
  <i><a href="https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/bonsai/">CRIStAL laboratories, BONSAI team</a>, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France</i><br/>
  <p align="justify">I have been the main developer on RNA-Tailor, a software
  that for a given gene of interest whose genomic sequence is known, find all 
  transcripts present in the sample that corresponds to this gene and model the
  alternative transcripts.<br/>
  <b>Tech Stack:</b> Biopython, Python, Snakemake, Ubuntu

    <p align="justify">I worked on the Vidjil software, where I optimized time
    and memory consumption for a sequence comparison algorithm in C++11. The 
    algorithm used the Aho-Corasick automaton that I adapted to the sequences
    (by decomposing them into kmers).<br/>
    <b>Tech Stack:</b> C++11, Makefile, Ubuntu
