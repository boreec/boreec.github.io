If you read the [the previous devlog entry](/posts/devlog-0001), you may have
noticed that the website appearance changed in the meantime. Previously, the
website images kept shimmering and as far as I understood it seems to be a
recurring bug with the Jekyll's theme
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). There's probably an
easy fix that I overlooked, but in the end I decided to change to something
else.

The current website is generated with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The migration
of the blog posts and pages was relatively quick since there was not so much
content.

Anyway, enough back and forth, let's dive into this blog entry. This month I've
especially been focusing on implementing a way for the character to leave and
enter maps
