If you've read the [devlog entry](/posts/devlog-0001) that I released in
January, you might have observed a change in the website's appearance since
then. Indeed, earlier the site images had a persistent shimmer, which appeared
to be a recurring issue with Jekyll's
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). While there might
be a simple fix that I might have missed, I opted to switch to a complete 
different theme in the end!

The current website is now generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a really
fast and lightweight framework for building static website. Migrating the blog 
posts and pages was a swift process, given the limited amount of content I've
written so far.

Anyway, enough smalltalk, let's dive into this blog entry. This month I've
especially been focusing on implementing a way for the character to leave and
enter maps with a few extra.
