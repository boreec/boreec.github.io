## Migration: Bevy v0.12.1 to v0.13.1

For migrating the keyboard inputs, I used the awesome site [taintedcoders.com](https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/input/),
which has great and up to date documentation.

## Final result

Here's a quick video showcasing all new features/mechanics/content/etc.

## Closing thoughts

As always, if you have any suggestions/remarks regarding the devlog content, the
code or anything else, please reach out! Don't hesitate to drop a &#11088; on the [project's page](https://github.com/boreec/roguelike).
