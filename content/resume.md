## In a few words

I am **Cyprien Borée**, a software engineer in his twenties from France. Since
2022, I have been living in Japan, Aichi prefecture with my wife and son.

My interest for computer science covers a wide range of areas, from the
tangible, like low-level languages, data structures and algorithms, to the more
abstract, including complexity theory, multi-objective optimization, multi-agent
systems, bioinformatics, cryptography, game engineering and many others.

Besides that, I enjoy watching movies, playing board games such as chess or
shogi and expanding my knowledge in surprising directions.

### Work experience

- **Backend developer** (April 2023 → Now)  
  [Tensor Energy](https://www.tensorenergy.jp/), Fukuoka Prefecture,
  Japan (remote)  
  - I work on the infrastructure/back-end part of Tensor Energy cloud platform.
  My role involves deploying and maintaining services within our distributed
  monolithic architecture. Specifically, I have been focusing on transactional
  and informational email service, energy forecast visualization and accuracy
  service, internal infrastructure monitoring  service, and the main data lake.
  Additionally, I have contributed to the establishment of unified tooling,
  naming conventions and coding standards across repositories.  
  - **Tech Stack:** AWS (CDK, Cognito, EventBridge, Gateway API, IoT, Lambda,
  RDS, Route 53, S3, SQS, Timestream), Docker, Figma, Github Actions, Github
  Registry, Go, Grafana, GraphQL, Linear, Metaflow, Postgresql, Python,
  Sendgrid, SSH, Typescript
- **C++ developer intern** (March 2021 → July 2021)  
  [CRIStAL laboratories, ORKAD team](https://orkad.univ-lille.fr),
  Villeneuve d'Ascq, France  
  - I worked on multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). My goal was to
  define diversity criteria for these problem solutions and benchmark their
  differences they compared to the literature. My approach was based on
  memoization to efficiently compute each solution's contribution to overall
  diversity.  
  - **Tech Stack:** C++17, Make
- **C++ developer intern** (October 2020 → February 2021)  
  [CRIStAL laboratories, SMAC team](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/SMAC),
  Villeneuve d'Ascq, France
  - I worked on simulating the spread of viruses on a multi-agent system built
    on a random social network (Barabasi-Albert). The goal was to model the
    spread of Covid in France and make predictions.
  - **Tech Stack:** C++11, Make
- **Python developer** (June 2019 → September 2020)  
  [CRIStAL laboratories, BONSAI team](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/bonsai),
  Villeneuve d'Ascq, France
  - I have been the main developer of RNA-Tailor, a software that, for a given
    gene of interest with a known genomic sequence, finds all transcripts
    present in the sample that correspond to this gene and models the
    alternative transcripts.
  - **Tech Stack:** Biopython, Python, Snakemake, Ubuntu
- **C++ developer intern** (April 2018 → June 2018)  
  [CRIStAL laboratories, BONSAI team](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/bonsai),
  Villeneuve d'Ascq, France
  - I worked on the Vidjil software, where I optimized time and memory
    consumption for a sequence comparison algorithm. The algorithm used the
    Aho-Corasick automaton that I adapted to the sequences decomposing them
    into k-mers)
  - **Tech Stack:** C++11, Makefile, Ubuntu
- **C/C++ developer intern** (April 2017 → June 2017)  
  [Oyama Kousen](https://www.oyama-ct.ac.jp/), Tochigi Prefecture, Japan  
  - I developed image recognition software in C/C++ for the Tsukuba Challenge,
    a robotic contest.
  - **Tech Stack:** ARGP, C, C++, FANN, OpenCV
